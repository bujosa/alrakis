## üê∂ Bark - Generate Audio from Text

### üë• Speaker Prompts

You can provide certain speaker prompts such as NARRATOR, MAN, WOMAN, etc. Please note that these are not always respected, especially if a conflicting audio history prompt is given.

```python
text_prompt = """
    WOMAN: I would like an oatmilk latte please.
    MAN: Wow, that's expensive!
"""
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)
```

## üíª Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/suno-ai/bark
cd bark && pip install .
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware and Inference Speed

Bark has been tested and works on both CPU and GPU (`pytorch 2.0+`, CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 12.0).
Running Bark requires running >100M parameter transformer models.
On modern GPUs and PyTorch nightly, Bark can generate audio in roughly realtime. On older GPUs, default colab, or CPU, inference time might be 10-100x slower.

If you don't have new hardware available or if you want to play with bigger versions of our models, you can also sign up for early access to our model playground [here](https://3os84zs17th.typeform.com/suno-studio).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Details

Similar to [Vall-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111) and some other amazing work in the field, Bark uses GPT-style
models to generate audio from scratch. Different from Vall-E, the initial text prompt is embedded into high-level semantic tokens without the use of phonemes. It can therefore generalize to arbitrary instructions beyond speech that occur in the training data, such as music lyrics, sound effects or other non-speech sounds. A subsequent second model is used to convert the generated semantic tokens into audio codec tokens to generate the full waveform. To enable the community to use Bark via public code we used the fantastic
[EnCodec codec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) from Facebook to act as an audio representation.

Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well on [Discord](https://discord.gg/J2B2vsjKuE)!

- `[laughter]`
- `[laughs]`
- `[sighs]`
- `[music]`
- `[gasps]`
- `[clears throat]`
- `‚Äî` or `...` for hesitations
- `‚ô™` for song lyrics
- capitalization for emphasis of a word
- `MAN/WOMAN:` for bias towards speaker
